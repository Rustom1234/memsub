- Durable capture layer 1 built and tested: ~/scripts/memsub-inbox.sh (SessionEnd/PreCompact hook target), ~/scripts/memsub-inbox-sweep.sh (5-min cron sweep, tested live, captured 2 transcripts into ~/.memsub/inbox/).
- Crontab install and ~/.claude/settings.json hook edit are blocked for agent sessions by the permission classifier. One-shot installer for Rustom: bash ~/scripts/install-durable-capture.sh (idempotent, installs 3 cron lines + 2 hooks with jq merge and .bak).
- Technical visuals written: docs/improvement-visuals-2026-07-17.md (durable capture, fact fusion, bounded decomposition, provenance signing, J-score comparability).
- Background agent (sonnet) implementing Part B items 1+2 (write-time fusion, query decomposition) with eval streaming to results/multihop-improvements-2026-07-17.json.
